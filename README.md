# Food Me

### Why
I want to try a different lifestyle and that involves changing my meals. The issue I'm having is knowing nutrient information while I'm changing recipes around. 

### How
By creating an application that allows for simple drag and drop into an area that is essentially the "recipe". There will be a window showing nutrient information, and changes in real-time.

### Problem
The user needs an UI that allows them to easily move items from one area to the other. The important part is being able to view the changes in data.

### Possible Features
- Create defaults
- Set bounds for datafields
  - different colors for distance from set bound
- Able to define ingredients and nutrition needs, then 
application will be able to create possible recipes.

## MVP
- ingredient section
  - can add, remove ingredients.
  - this is more like an inventonry bag in a game per se
- nutrient information section
  - read-only, no interact
- auth
  - save recipes
- export
  - json
  - csv
